## Overview

College Cuisine Connect is a project dedicated to helping students with limited cooking skills and resources find quality and healthy recipes. It aims to foster a sense of community by allowing students to share their own culinary experiences and support each other in their culinary journeys.

The system provides a centralized platform that curates a diverse range of recipes tailored to the specific needs and constraints of college life. Recognizing that many students may have limited access to a fully equipped kitchen or face time constraints, College Cuisine Connect emphasizes recipes that are not only nutritious but also quick, budget-friendly, and easy to execute.

Through a user-friendly interface, students can explore a variety of recipes, ranging from simple microwave-based meals to those requiring minimal cooking equipment. The platform also takes into consideration dietary preferences, allergies, and restrictions to ensure inclusivity and accommodate diverse needs within the UH community.

## Purpose

College Cuisine Connect aims to accomplish the following goals:

- Provide a curated collection of simple and healthy toaster oven capable recipes suitable for students.
- Encourage students to adopt nutritious eating habits.
- Create a supportive community for sharing recipes and cooking experiences.

### Problem Statement:

Many college students struggle to maintain a healthy diet due to time constraints, limited cooking facilities, and a lack of easy-to-follow recipes tailored to their specific needs. The absence of a dedicated platform catering to students with toaster ovens exacerbates the issue, as conventional cooking resources often overlook this common dormitory appliance. Consequently, students find it challenging to adopt nutritious eating habits, leading to a higher prevalence of unhealthy dietary choices and potential long-term health issues.

### Solution:

In response to these challenges, we propose "College Cuisine Connect," a comprehensive platform designed to address the unique culinary needs of college students. Our solution involves providing a carefully curated collection of simple and healthy toaster oven-capable recipes specifically tailored for students, taking into account their time constraints and limited cooking resources. By doing so, we aim to empower students to make healthier food choices without compromising on convenience. Moreover, our platform will foster a supportive community where students can share their favorite recipes and cooking experiences, creating a collaborative environment that encourages the adoption of nutritious eating habits. Through College Cuisine Connect, we envision a positive shift in the dietary choices and overall well-being of college students, promoting a healthier lifestyle during their academic journey.

## Community Feedback

We sought feedback from the community, and here are some reflections and thoughts shared with us.

- "I liked how the single recipe would pop up when viewing instead of taking me to another page."
- "The aesthetics were really pleasing, but what I really liked about it was how easy it was to navigate through the site without getting lost or confused."
- "I feel like a search bar would make the website easier to browse through."
- "The navigational bar at the top could have some aesthetic improvements "

Overall, the design and functionality were well-received, with most participants expressing positive sentiments. The application was unanimously considered easy to understand and navigate.
